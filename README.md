## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
### 1. Project Background & Problem Statement
Singapore, a global education hub, attracts a significant number of international students. However, securing suitable rental accommodation presents a major challenge for these students. The process is often time-consuming, fragmented, and characterized by information asymmetry. Prospective tenants must navigate complex trade-offs between multiple, often competing, objectives such as proximity to their educational institution, commute time, rental budget, housing type, and availability of nearby amenities. Existing rental platforms lack the intelligent, personalized capabilities required to address the specific needs of this demographic effectively.
### 2. Project Objective & Proposed Solution
To address this gap, our team has developed the Intelligent Recommendation System, an AI-powered rental platform specifically designed for international students in Singapore. The core objective of this system is to streamline the property search process by intelligently identifying accommodation that best matches a user's unique and multi-faceted preferences. It transforms a traditionally manual and frustrating search into an efficient, data-driven decision-making process. A key differentiator of our system is its dual-mode interface, catering to both structured and natural user interactions.
### 3. System Methodology & Core Workflow
Our solution operates through a robust, user-centric workflow:
- Dual-Mode Input Interface: The system accepts user requirements through both a structured form for precise filtering and a conversational Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface, allowing users to express their needs freely and intuitively (e.g., "I need a cheap room under 1200$ near NUS, maybe 30 minutes away, and close to an MRT").
- Intelligent Filtering & Multi-Objective Optimization: The system processes the input (either structured or parsed from natural language) to filter the property database. It then employs a sophisticated weighted scoring model to rank properties based on three critical dimensions: Rent, Location, and Facility convenience, weighted by user-defined importance.
- Explainable AI Recommendations: A pivotal feature of our system is its ability to generate personalized explanation for each recommendation. For every listed property, the system provides a clear, data-driven rationale (e.g., "This apartment is recommended because it offers the shortest commute to your school (15 mins) and is within your budget, despite being slightly further from the MRT"), thereby building user trust and transparency.
### 4. Key Outcomes & Value Delivered
The successful development of the Intelligent Recommendation System demonstrates:
- Enhanced Usability & Accessibility: The conversational NLP interface makes the system accessible to users regardless of their technical proficiency, accommodating a wide range of query styles.
- Decision Intelligence & Transparency: The combination of multi-objective optimization and explainable recommendations not only identifies optimal listings but also justifies why they are optimal, empowering users to make confident, informed decisions.
- High Efficiency: The system processes complex user queries and returns highly relevant, explained recommendations within seconds, dramatically improving the entire search and evaluation workflow.
### 5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the Intelligent Recommendation System provides a highly efficient, intelligent, and user-adaptive rental solution for international students in Singapore. It transcends traditional filtering tools by integrating natural language understanding and explainable AI, creating a comprehensive decision-support system poised to significantly enhance the student accommodation search experience and facilitate a smoother transition to academic life in Singapore.
